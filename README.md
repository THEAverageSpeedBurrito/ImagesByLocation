# Flickr Finder

### Project concept
The goal behind this project is to combine the functionality of the Google Maps API and the Flickr API. Coordinates are obtained from Google Maps and passed into the Flickr API which then returns a series of images within a predefined radius of those coordinates.

### Additional functionality
Additional functionality is primarily centered around the processing of returned images. When an image is clicked an action bar becomes visible and presents the user with a series of actions. An action may be something like expanding an image for preview, adding it to a collection, or downloading a high quality version.

### API's
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
* [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)


### (Stretch) goals
* Include an image processing API to perform a variety of functions on a selected image.
* Allow users to tag images
* Allow downloading of entire collections
* Interactive search modifier bar
